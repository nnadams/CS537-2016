2a
    - Created simple whoosh shell
        - Get line of input, check if it's a built in cmd, if so handle it
        - If not, fork
            - Parent waits for child to return
            - Child
                - Build the args list
                - If doing redirection close std's and open specified files
                - Try and execute the given command in each availible path

2b
    - Added priority field to proc structure
    - Add pstats which holds process info
    - Added 2 system calls: setpri and getpinfo
    - Updated scheduler to schedule according to priority
        - Starting at the slot after the last scheduled proc, check the table
      for a process with priority 2. Wrap around to the beginning of the list.
        - If no 2 is found check the list again for any runnable process
